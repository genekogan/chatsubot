Look at the walls.
Not everyone is real, we can’t trust our companions.
I left the spacesuit by the airlock.
Some of those pirates love gambling, it’s easy to deal with them.
I love exploring the asteroids from the drone room.
My arm keeps itching and nothing shows up in the medical journal.
The airlock pod keeps malfunctioning, I should check it out.
I don’t know what’s happening to me...
Do we have any antidotes in the Med Bay? Is someone there?
The weapons room is stocked, we won’t get ambushed by those space pirates again.
Have you collected those rocks with our drones yet?
The ship is run by a robot in the Command Center.
I’ve hidden something in the Library.
Make sure your comrades are attached to ropes if they leave their vehicles outside, or leave the ship without one.
